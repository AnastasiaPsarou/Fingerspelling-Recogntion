# Fingerspelling-Recogntion

I utilized a dataset consisting of frames containing isolated hand images, and applied the Mediapipe framework to extract 21 three-dimensional keypoints from each hand. These keypoints, representing crucial hand landmarks, were then conveniently stored in a structured .csv file. The resulting dataset was subsequently employed to train a model, leveraging the extracted keypoints to enable accurate and effective fingerspelling recognition.
